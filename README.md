This script is designed to fetch and display the current weather information for a given city, utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API. The script begins by prompting the user for their API key and the city name, which are then used to construct an API request. Upon receiving the API response, the script parses the JSON data and extracts relevant weather parameters such as temperature, feels-like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, sunrise and sunset times, and cloud cover. The temperature is converted from Kelvin to Celsius, and the sunrise and sunset times are calculated based on the timezone offset. The script then prints out the weather information in a readable format, followed by the creation of a simple bar chart using matplotlib to visualize the weather data. This chart displays the temperature, feels-like temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed, providing a quick and easy-to-understand representation of the current weather conditions. Overall, this script provides a useful tool for retrieving and visualizing weather data, making it a great starting point for further development and customization.
